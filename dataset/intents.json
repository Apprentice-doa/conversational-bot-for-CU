Landing a serve on the line is considered good.\nNet - The net stands 3 feet and 6 inches high where the posts lie while the middle of the net is 3 feet tall, with the posts 3 feet outside of the court on either side. Hitting a ball into the net is considered an out while any ball that hits the net cord and falls onto the other side is considered good except for a serve, which allows for a re-do, or let.\nService Line - The service line separates the forecourt from the back court, and it also marks the length of the service box.\nSingles Sideline - The singles sideline is the innermost line running lengthwise and determines the boundary of play for singles matches as well as the width of the service box.\nDoubles Sideline - The doubles sideline is the outermost line running lengthwise and is only used in doubles matches."],
