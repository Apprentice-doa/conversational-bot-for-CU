"Baseline - The baselines are the lines on either end of the court that determines the boundaries of play going lengthwise. They are also where a player serves behind.
Center Mark - The center mark determines the two halves of the tennis court. It mainly helps with service to determine where a player should stand prior to serving.
Center Line - The center line divides the two service boxes into a distinct left service box and right service box on either side of the court. Landing a serve on the line is considered good.
Net - The net stands 3 feet and 6 inches high where the posts lie while the middle of the net is 3 feet tall, with the posts 3 feet outside of the court on either side. Hitting a ball into the net is considered an out while any ball that hits the net cord and falls onto the other side is considered good except for a serve, which allows for a re-do, or let.
Service Line - The service line separates the forecourt from the back court, and it also marks the length of the service box.
Singles Sideline - The singles sideline is the innermost line running lengthwise and determines the boundary of play for singles matches as well as the width of the service box.
Doubles Sideline - The doubles sideline is the outermost line running lengthwise and is only used in doubles matches.",3
"A flip of the coin or spin of the racket, known as the toss, determines which player or team serves first. If called correctly, the player or team that did so chooses who serves first. The player/team who did not call it correctly decides which side of the court they want to play on first.",6
